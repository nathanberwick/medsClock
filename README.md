# medsClock
keep forgetting whether you've taken your mediation?

This arduino based clock should be pretty nifty.

when you press the button, an LED lights to show you that you've taken the meds.
the light won't turn off until a new day begins.

Available with an array of LEDs.
The default version has just one LED.
The deluxe edition has three LEDs.

reset the lights by holding the button for 2s.
