# medsClock
keep forgetting whether you've taken your medication?

This arduino based clock should be pretty nifty.

when you press the button, an LED lights to show you that you've taken the meds.
the light won't turn off until midnight, the reset time.

Available with an array of LEDs.
The default version has just one LED.
The deluxe edition has three LEDs.

reset the lights by holding the button for 2s.

Hour and Minute increment buttons are included internally to set the clock.
